# In this module I am learning about scripting in bash.

This repository contains work from the module Embedded Systems Scripting.
we are currently learning how to create basic CLI programs within bash.

Our first assignment involves creating an education tool for students in a primary school to learn basic metematics skills by practicing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. When the student is comfortable with the practice questions, they can then take a test to see how well they have learned the skills.
